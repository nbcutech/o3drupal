Decisions 6.x branch (HEAD, in progress)
----------------------------------------

 * 6.x port
 * VotingAPI 2.x support (DRUPAL-6--2 branch, specifically)
 * Cleanup of some forms submission processes (no more $_POST!)
 * This port drops a few functionalities and may still be broken in
   many ways. In particular, the Javascript is gone from the "More
   choices" option.
 * Some voting calculations may also be broken and have not been
   tested.
 * Do not rely on REMOTE_ADDR environment, use ip_address() (fixes
   voting through proxy servers)
 * Ranking and selection have been tested and work generally well.
 * Provide better messages to explain why users cannot vote, or see results.
 * Users who are in the electoral list, but who are not in a role with
   permissions to vote, are no longer allowed to vote.
